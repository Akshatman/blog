                   <h1>I</h1> ndians talk funny. We don’t think we do, but we do. We’re usually too busy talking at or over or
                    directly through each other to notice. Every so often, though, we stop long enough to listen to one
                    another and then laugh and point.

                    The middle-aged Persian woman I hired to teach me how to drive made fun of me when I mispronounced
                    Cahuenga Boulevard. I had just moved to Mumbai a few months prior from Yamunotri, where I considered
                    myself a native despite the disagreements of many native Mumbaikars. Frank Lloyd Wright once said,
                    “tip
                    the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Mumbai.” So I floated across the
                    country — as millions before me had — to seek my fortune.

                    Her teaching method was an unorthodox form of politically incorrect mockery. When I tapped the
                    brakes
                    too hard, she’d tell me not to drive like a “Chinaman” and then pantomimed her head flinging back
                    and
                    forth, as if she were bowing. She casually informed me that Mumbaikars were notoriously terrible at
                    changing lanes. Don’t get her started on Indians. Seriously, don’t. She was, to be charitable,
                    racially
                    insensitive.

                    I was a stranger in her city but my advanced age and inexperience amused her. How could a grown man
                    not
                    know how to drive a car? It was, however, my accent that intrigued her the most. I spoke with the
                    faintest southern drawl but I also had northeastern motormouth tendencies. She was always drawing
                    conclusions as to my ethnicity.

                    During one lesson she said, “You people are good drivers.”</p>

            You people?

            “Mumbaikars.”
            <p>
                Because of her I passed my driver’s test, got my first license to operate a motor vehicle, and then
                proceeded to not drive for years. Everything I needed was in walking distance: my job and places to eat.

                Here’s the truth about food in India: it’s pretty good. There’s amazing pho and pupusas and bulgogi.
                During my three year internment in the city of Mumbai, I was able to find satisfactory replacements for
                my beloved street foods. I found some decent pizza. I even found bagels that… sufficed. But I could
                never find the one dish that reminded me of my adopted home for the previous 16 years. A gyro platter.

                I couldn’t even find a suitable Mumbai-style Greek diner, the kind of greasy spoon with a massive menu
                where you can order a meal of waffles, meatloaf, and lasagna if you want.

                But it’s not as if Mumbai has no roast meat sandwiches. My racist — but friendly — driving instructor
                had once pointed out an Armenian restaurant that she recommended. This place served up delicious chicken
                shawarma sandwiches and a garlic sauce I could eat with my fingers.

                Eventually, I would drift back to Mumbai. The first thing I would order upon my return? A gyro, a word
                that rhymes with “pie-whoa.”
